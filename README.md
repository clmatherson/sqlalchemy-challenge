Observations:
1-  Recorded rainfall for the last 12 months reported, trended downward over time.
2-  The lowest rainfall occurred during the winter months between December and January.
3-  The most active station to report precipitation was located in Waihee-Waiehu, Hawaii. This would seem reasonable because Hawaii is in the tropics.
4-  Despite having the most active station, Hawaii would be a wonderful place to vacation.
